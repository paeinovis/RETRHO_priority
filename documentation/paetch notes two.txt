paetch notes two

2/25/2025:
- fixed template vs code discrepancies and changed "Altitude" to CURRENT altitude


2/26/2025
- fixed rise/set time vs. altitude discrepancy (it was in fact timezones)
- fixed custom plot altitude issue


4/13/25:
- I've done other shit since Feb., just don't remember lol. Anyway. 
- Hopefully fixed an issue with retaining ALL form responses in All Responses tab
- Made data validation rules more fucken clear bc ppl are dunces


4/19/2025:
- Added altitude vs time plot
- Changed "star from name" to "object from name"


9/5/2025:
- Added sun, moon altazs to plots as well as darkness shading
- Fixed a timezone print issue
- Added SSO to list of observatories in dropdown
- Fixed observer not updating issue caused by global variable behavior; darkness shading now functions correctly


10/8/2025:
- updated headers corresponding to template updates


10/10/2025: 
- submission code: target expiration has been fixed; data validation rigidity for multiple-target sheet updated; loosened restrictions on ra/dec for multiple and single target submission; updated error codes for specificity and completeness; organized code more and added more commentary, as well as spacing for legibility; tested and debugged quite a bit also


10/25/2025:
- tried and failed to find a reasonable solution to ephemerides so temporarily giving up on that
- added altitude limits and shading
- changed layout of inputs/buttons for readability
- added sunrise/sunset times to observer values tab (tab 4)

priRHOrity TODO:
- add side by side printed panes
- moon stuff (brightness, angular distance)
- add auto update toggle (ETA: idk what I meant by this.)
- add solar system ephemera??
- maybe try to combine airmass and altitude into one window but it looks really difficult for no reason (maybe one button makes two windows?)
- add search-observatory feature (default csv observatories but also searchable)
