priRHOrity TODO:
- BUG: timezones and airmass plot dont agree (check package versions ???)
- add side by side printed panes
- moon stuff (brightness, angular distance)
- add auto update toggle (ETA: idk what I meant by this.)
- add sunrise/sunset info? (should be easy)
- add solar system ephemera??
- maybe try to combine airmass and altitude into one window but it looks really difficult for no reason (maybe two windows?)
