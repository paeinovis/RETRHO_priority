priRHOrity TODO:
- add side by side printed panes
- moon stuff (brightness, angular distance)
- add auto update toggle (ETA: idk what I meant by this.)
- add sunrise/sunset info? (should be easy)
- add solar system ephemera??
- maybe try to combine airmass and altitude into one window but it looks really difficult for no reason (maybe one button makes two windows?)
- altitude horizontal line for airmass/alt plots
-> requires us to add customizable altaz limits to fourth tab blahblah
