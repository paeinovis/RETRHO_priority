paetch notes (7/3-7/4/2024):

-made sheet for RETRHO roster or RETRHOster, including list of observers, status (junior/senior), contact info in the form of emails, and checkmarks for which WGs they are in
-added contact page which will email the uf.retrho gmail when responses are submitted
-made it so application form also emails uf.retrho
-limited signup to 5 people per obs night (may be capped to 4 in future)
-updated form descriptions and auto emails of signup/followup for clarity in instructions
-added calendar functionality to signup process (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YzE4MGI4ZmMxNjkyM2FmMDczMmIyZDRhNDZhODc4YTkwNjZjNzhiY2Y2YjMwMjA2NmFjZDYzNmRlZjJkZTk3MkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) 
-added sunset/sunrise functionality to google calendar based on date, *approximating* time of dusk and dawn for each month. so whenever you sign up to observe on a given night, the google calendar event will use those start/end times as approx. the amount of time to block off. this uses suggested sunrise/sunset dates (based on night and twilight values from timeanddate.com)
->had to account for daylight savings time my beloathed

-made mini manual on pre-check procedures
-fixed my stupid coordinates code which I Knew wasn't going to be good enough when I wrote it but didn't bother to fix it until now which was silly.
-priority/planning program: 
	-no longer has string silliness w/ coordinates (my fault, was lazy abt it)
	- no longer matters if simbad recognizes a name in tab 2 (uploaded spreadsheet tab), since coordinates are given in sheet (i.e., will default to coordinates if name does not return a result. this means it won't be able to give info on every object but Will be able to tell if it's up and can plot it)
	- have probably shot the efficiency to trash trying to work out other bugs but that's. fine. will work that out later lol
	- added Up functionality for uploaded target sheet objects

-added setting/rising/circumpolar functionality

----------------------------------

priority todo:
-eventually Algo pick best targets for a night

-is observable or not functionality (constraints in astroplan)
-add added targets to sheet (I don't remember what this means...............)
-add .exe file to run planning.py
-glitch w changing time altitude for HD 219134 (??? cant replicate)

manual:
